          At UmugandaTech, we believe in the power of community and the
          potential of technology to amplify it. Born from the rich tradition
          of Rwanda collective action, our platform is designed to empower
          both community leaders and citizens. We provide the digital tools
          to make mobilization smarter, participation more rewarding, and
          social impact more measurable.
